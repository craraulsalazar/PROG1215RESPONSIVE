			<p>Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,  that all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates,  and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell  'stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. 'A nice  muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' thought Alice.</p>

			<p>One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice  could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and  very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly  that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out  at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was  obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was  of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.</p>

			<p>'Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.</p>

			<p>On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then  unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:&mdash;</p>

			<p>'The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, All on a summer day: The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, And took them quite away!'</p>

			<p>'Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.</p>

			<p>'Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. 'There's a great  deal to come before that!'</p>

			<p>'Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three  blasts on the trumpet, and called out, 'First witness!'</p>

			<p>The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one  hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. 'I beg pardon, your  Majesty,' he began, 'for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished  my tea when I was sent for.'</p>

			<p>'You ought to have finished,' said the King. 'When did you begin?'</p>
